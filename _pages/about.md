My research interests encompass 1) Privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly deep learning with differential privacy, and 2) Memorization mechanisms within large-scale models. 

I am a Research Scientist at Google Research. I earned my Ph.D. from Sun Yat-sen University in 2024, where I had the privilege of being supervised by Prof. [Tie-Yan Liu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/) and Prof. [Jian Yin](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Jian_Yin3). During my Ph.D., I was a member of the [Joint PhD program between Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/zh-cn/connections/academic-programs/joint-phd) and Sun Yat-sen University. I received a [Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/articles/eleven-phd-students-are-awarded-the-2021-microsoft-research-asia-fellowship-award/) in 2021. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Sun Yat-sen University in 2019.
