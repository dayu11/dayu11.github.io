My recent research interests are: 1) Enabling Gemini to power breakthrough applications through tool-use and RL, 2) Improving methods for privacy-preserving machine learning.

I am a Research Scientist at Google Research. I earned my Ph.D. from Sun Yat-sen University in 2024, where I had the privilege of being supervised by Prof. [Tie-Yan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Nh832fgAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Jian Yin](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Jian_Yin3). During my Ph.D., I was a member of the [Joint PhD program between Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/zh-cn/connections/academic-programs/joint-phd) and Sun Yat-sen University. I received a [Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/articles/eleven-phd-students-are-awarded-the-2021-microsoft-research-asia-fellowship-award/) in 2021. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Sun Yat-sen University in 2019.
